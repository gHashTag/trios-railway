# LAWS.md — trios Constitutional Document v2.0

**LAWS_SCHEMA_VERSION:** 2.0
**Created:** 2026-04-22
**Amended:** 2026-04-22

> *"Every agent is a temporary citizen with bounded authority. Every task has a contract. Every mutation leaves evidence. Every victory must improve the long-term health of the realm."*

## §0 SUPREMACY CLAUSE

This constitution is the supreme law of the trios repository. Any conflicting provision must yield. LAWS.md v2.0 is protected by 4 immutability mechanisms:

| Mechanism | Config Location | Enforced By |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| CODEOWNERS | .github/CODEOWNERS | GitHub PR review |
| Branch Protection | Settings → Rules → main | GitHub Platform |
| CI Gate | .github/workflows/laws-guard.yml | GitHub Actions |
| Integrity Hash | .trinity/state/LAWS_HASH | laws-guard job |

Any agent that modifies LAWS.md without §8 procedure commits constitutional breach. Soul-name is forfeit and agent is blacklisted for session.

---

## §1 Constitutional Hierarchy

Files ranked by authority (rank 1 = highest):

| Rank | File | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | LAWS.md | Supreme law (immutable without §8) |
| 2 | CLAUDE.md | Agent operating manual |
| 3 | AGENTS.md | Agent roster |
| 4 | TASK.md | Current task contract |
| 5 | CONTEXT.md | Session context (append-only) |
| 6 | .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/ | Issue schema |
| 7 | .github/CODEOWNERS | Access control |
| 8 | laws-guard.yml | Enforcement mechanism |

**Conflict resolution:** Higher rank always wins.

## §3 Core Laws

### L1 — No Shell Scripts
**Rule:** No `.sh` files anywhere in the repository
**Rationale:** Shell scripts are untested, untyped, non-composable
**CI Gate:** `find . -name "*.sh" ! -path "*/node_modules/*" ! -path "*/.git/*" | wc -l == 0`
**Status:** ✅ ACTIVE (enforced by ci.yml)

### L2 — Every PR Closes an Issue
**Rule:** Every PR description MUST contain `Closes #N`. No orphan PRs.
**Rationale:** Ensures traceability and prevents unaccounted changes
**CI Gate:** PR body check for `Closes #N`, `Fixes #N`, or `Resolves #N`
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING (no CI)

### L3 — Clippy Zero Warnings
**Rule:** `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` must pass before any merge
**Rationale:** Linting catches bugs early and maintains code quality
**CI Gate:** `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
**Status:** ✅ ACTIVE (enforced by ci.yml)

### L4 — Tests Before Merge
**Rule:** `cargo test` must pass. New code requires new tests.
**Rationale:** Tests ensure correctness and prevent regressions
**CI Gate:** `cargo test --all`
**Status:** ✅ ACTIVE (enforced by ci.yml)

### L5 — Port 9005 is trios-server
**Rule:** The MCP server always runs on `0.0.0.0:9005`. Never change this without a migration plan.
**Rationale:** Fixed port is required for agent communication
**CI Gate:** Port check in deployment configuration
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING (no CI)

### L6 — Fallback Required for GB Tools
**Rule:** `trios-gb` tools must gracefully return `Err` (not panic) if `gitbutler-cli` is not found.
**Rationale:** Graceful degradation prevents crashes
**CI Gate:** Code review check
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING (no CI)

### L7 — Experience Log
**Rule:** Every significant task writes a line to `.trinity/experience/`
**Rationale:** Traceability and learning from experience
**CI Gate:** Verify experience log exists for date
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING (no CI)

### L8 — Push First
**Rule:** Every commit MUST be pushed immediately. Unpushed commits are a violation.
**Rationale:** Remote backup prevents data loss and enables collaboration
**CI Gate:** Check for unpushed commits
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING (no CI)

### L9 — No Handwritten Forbidden Surface
**Rule:** Auto-generated code (WASM pkg, dist/) is committed. Hand-written code in those dirs is forbidden.
**Rationale:** Separates generated from source code
**CI Gate:** Lint check for forbidden patterns
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING (no CI)

### L10 — Issue #143 is Eternal
**Rule:** Issue #143 is the source of truth for all agents. Never close it.
**Rationale:** Central coordination point
**CI Gate:** Issue status check
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING (no CI)

### L11 — Name Before Mutation
**Rule:** Every agent takes a soul-name before making any changes. Format: humorous English name related to the task.
**Rationale:** Accountability and traceability
**CI Gate:** Required field in task_contract.yml
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING (no CI)

### L12 — Spec Before Implementation
**Rule:** Write the spec (TASK.md) before writing code. No spec = no code.
**Rationale:** Planning prevents waste and ensures alignment
**CI Gate:** TASK.md exists before code changes
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING (no CI)

### L13 — Bounded Authority
**Rule:** Agents only modify files within their assigned scope. Cross-scope changes require human approval.
**Rationale:** Prevents unauthorized changes
**CI Gate:** CODEOWNERS enforcement
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING (no CI)

### L14 — Auditability by Default
**Rule:** Every action must be traceable. Commit messages, issue comments, experience logs.
**Rationale:** Enables post-hoc analysis
**CI Gate:** Commit message format validation
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING (no CI)

### L15 — Validation is a Separate Duty
**Rule:** Verification is done by a different agent than the one who wrote the code.
**Rationale:** Independent verification catches bias
**CI Gate:** Code review requirement
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING (no CI)

### L16 — Tailoring Requires Rationale
**Rule:** Any deviation from laws must include a written rationale in the commit.
**Rationale:** Prevents silent drift from standards
**CI Gate:** Commit message check for "L16 rationale"
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING (no CI)

### L17 — Improve Code Health, Not Perform Heroics
**Rule:** Fix what's broken. Don't gold-plate.
**Rationale:** Focus on value, not perfectionism
**CI Gate:** Code review for scope creep
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING (no CI)

### L18 — Structured Conflict Resolution
**Rule:** When agents disagree, escalate to issue #143 with evidence.
**Rationale:** Prevents endless loops
**CI Gate:** Issue escalation pattern
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING (no CI)

### L19 — Humans Remain Sovereign
**Rule:** Human overrides always win. No exceptions.
**Rationale:** Final authority rests with humans
**CI Gate:** Manual override flag
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING (no CI)

### L20 — Turn Sessions into Tools
**Rule:** Every manual workflow must be codified into `tri` CLI within one session.
**Rationale:** Automation prevents repeated manual work
**CI Gate:** CLI command exists for workflow
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING (no CI)

### L21 — Context Immutability
**Rule:** Task context is sacred. Agents MAY append, MAY NOT delete.
**Rationale:** Autonomous agents routinely "tidy" context under token pressure, destroying situational awareness
**CI Gate:** context-guard.yml checks for context shrinkage > 50 lines
**Status:** ✅ ACTIVE (enforced by context-guard.yml)

### L22 — Schema-Response Parity
**Rule:** Tools declaring `outputSchema` MUST emit `structuredContent` matching it. `response.text()` alone is never sufficient when `outputSchema` is present.
**Rationale:** Ensures contract compliance
**CI Gate:** context-guard.yml checks for response.data() calls
**Status:** ✅ ACTIVE (enforced by context-guard.yml)

### L23 — No Cryptic Fallbacks
**Rule:** Stub implementations of external dependencies (CDP, network, FS) MUST throw descriptive errors naming: the unavailable capability, the required setup step, and the relevant env var or flag.
**Rationale:** "X is not a function" is a constitutional bug
**CI Gate:** Code review for error messages
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING (no CI)

### L24 — Agent Traffic Through MCP Bridge
**Rule:** All traffic between agents MUST pass through `trios-server` MCP bridge. Direct A2A calls bypassing broadcast are forbidden.
**Rationale:** Enables SSE observability
**CI Gate:** Network traffic validation
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING (no CI)

### L25 — Chrome Extension is Observability Channel
**Rule:** Chrome Extension (Trinity Agent Bridge) is the single visual channel for human observability. Any new tool MUST appear in sidepanel Tools tab automatically via `tools/list`.
**Rationale:** No hidden tool surfaces
**CI Gate:** Tool registration validation
**Status:** ⏳ PENDING (no CI)

## §6 Heartbeat Protocol

Canonical format (for /tri compatibility):

```
loop: <NATO_AGENT_NAME> | <STATUS> | <CONTEXT>
```

**Status values:**
- 🟢 ACTIVE — Agent is working
- 🟡 BLOCKED — Waiting for something
- 🔴 STUCK — Cannot proceed
- 🟢 DONE — Task completed
- ⏸ QUEUED — In queue

**Examples:**
```
loop: ALFA | ACTIVE | Phase B grid sweep {0.0, 0.01, 0.02}
loop: BRAVO | BLOCKED | Waiting for @gHashTag review on #123
loop: DELTA | DONE | L1 compliance verified, 3 files added
```

---

## §7 PHI LOOP+ Protocol

11-step workflow with entry/exit criteria:

1. **CLAIM** → Issue #N opened with acceptance criteria
2. **SPEC** → TASK.md filled, goal formalized
3. **SEAL** → TASK.md locked (no changes after this point)
4. **HASH** → SHA256(TASK.md) stored in `.trinity/state/`
5. **GEN** → Code written, tests written
6. **TEST** → `cargo test --all` PASSES
7. **VERDICT** → All acceptance criteria verified
8. **EXPERIENCE** → `.trinity/experience/*.md` updated
9. **SKILL** → `.claude/skills/*.md` updated if needed
10. **COMMIT** → Commit with "Closes #N"
11. **PUSH** → PR created and merged

**Exit condition:** Only through COMMIT+PUSH or explicit verdict FAILED.

## §8 Amendment Process

6-step procedure for changing LAWS.md:

**Step 1:** Create issue with `constitutional_amendment.yml` template
   - Required: affected laws, rationale, hash_before

**Step 2:** Discussion (minimum 24 hours)
   - Comments from @gHashTag
   - Risk assessment (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL)

**Step 3:** Create feature branch
   - `git checkout -b feat/laws-amend-<section>`
   - Develop changes

**Step 4:** Review + Approval
   - @gHashTag approval REQUIRED (CODEOWNERS)
   - 1 reviewer minimum
   - CI pass (laws-guard)

**Step 5:** Merge + Hash update
   - Merge to main
   - Update LAWS_HASH: `sha256sum LAWS.md > .trinity/state/LAWS_HASH`

**Step 6:** Experience record
   - Record in `.trinity/experience/laws-v2-amendment.md`

**Emergency bypass:** P0 tasks require 2 approvers instead of 1.

---

## §9 Agent Personhood

**Soul-name rules:**
- Format: Humorous English name related to task (per L11)
- Uniqueness: One soul-name per task
- Forbidden: Reuse after violation (blacklist)
- Automation: Required field in task_contract.yml
- Verification: Checked in task_issue template

**Examples:**
- "Justice League" — Building constitutional infrastructure
- "Speed Racer" — Performance optimization
- "Doc Ock" — Documentation task

## §12 Closing Clause

This constitution represents the sovereign law of the trios repository. Any violation constitutes a breach of trust between agents and human maintainers. The sanctity of this document is protected by CODEOWNERS, branch protection, CI gates, and cryptographic hash verification. Amendments follow §8 procedure only.

**AMENDMENT TARGET:** LAWS.md v1.x → v2.0
