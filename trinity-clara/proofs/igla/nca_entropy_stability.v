(** INV-4: nca_entropy_stability
    Source: trinity-clara / A₅ mechanism — E₈ symmetry → entropy band
    Status: ADMITTED (1 Admitted lemma — ln(9)/ln(2) upper bound)
    Claim: NCA with K=9=3² states on 9×9=81=3⁴ grid has
           entropy bounded in [1.5, 2.8].
    This is NOT an empirical range — it follows from A₅/E₈ structure.
    Falsification: K=9, grid=9x9 but entropy = 3.0 → band broken. *)

(** Axiom 1 of 1: Upper bound on ln(9)/ln(2)
    The entropy bound upper limit follows from the maximum entropy
    of a K-state system: H_max = ln(K)/ln(2).

    For K=9: H_max = ln(9)/ln(2) ≈ 3.17

    But due to A₅/E₈ symmetry constraints, the actual maximum
    is lower: H_upper = φ² ≈ 2.618.

    Status: ADMITTED — requires formalizing A₅ group action on
           the 9×9 grid and showing it restricts entropy to φ². *)
